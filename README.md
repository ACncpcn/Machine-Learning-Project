# Machine Learning Project
### Audio Classification

This repository contains our project for a Machine Learning class. 

The aim is to create a system that can find songs that are similar based on the audio parameters. Music services recommend music based on tags and what other users like. However, this doesn't help promote music that a user may like based on music preference because a song may not be popular. Furthermore, some tags are broad and may not fully describe a musical type. 


The general idea is to be able to first detect pitch or chord using a trained model. 
Then the pattern of notes played will be found for a song. The final step would be to match the similarity of the pattern of notes to an existing database of songs.
